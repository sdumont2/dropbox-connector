# Alfresco to Dropbox Connector

## Description
  
This project was developed to allow users have synchronized content between
 Alfresco and Dropbox. It Expands on and updates Alfresco's original, unsupported,
  integration [found here](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-dropbox-integration).
   The project works by leveraging Dropbox's new API through
  [Dropbox's Java SDK](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/java) in order
  to make API calls to push and pull content between Alfresco and Dropbox.

## Important to Note

 * Runs using Community and/or Enterprise assets (**Must** use Alfresco Community 5.0.b or higher)
 * Does not yet actively check for updates between Alfresco and Dropbox (needs to be manually updated from Alfresco using document actions)

## Project RoadMap
 
  * Extensive testing
  * Dropbox "App" it is connected to needs to be put to "Production"
  * Clean up/Polish code and remove unused classes
  * Enhance Readme to include a breakdown of features and how to use them
